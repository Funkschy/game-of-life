# Conway's Game of Life in Kantan

Simple Implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in my own programming language [Kantan](https://github.com/funkschy/kantan-lang)
Uses SDL2

## Getting started
You need the dependencies for SDL2
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Funkschy/game-of-life
cd game-of-life
make # Change the Kantan path inside the Makefile if neccessary
./gol
```

## Usage

Press escape to quit the game.
